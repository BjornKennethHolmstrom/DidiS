# DidiS Project Compatibility Notes

## Current React Version Issue
The project is using React 19 (alpha/rc), which causes compatibility issues with several commonly used packages:

```
react@19.0.0-rc-02c0e824-20241028
```

### Known Incompatible Packages
1. `recharts` - Requires React 16-18
2. `react-hook-form` - Requires React 16-18
3. Most packages that haven't been updated for React 19

### Current Workarounds
1. Use custom SVG implementations instead of recharts
2. Use native React state management instead of react-hook-form
3. Build simpler, custom components instead of using complex third-party libraries

### Future Solutions
1. Wait for React 19 stable release
2. Wait for package maintainers to update their dependencies
3. Consider downgrading to React 18 if needed

### Decision Log
- Decided to build custom components to avoid dependency issues
- Using native browser APIs where possible
- Focusing on lightweight, dependency-free solutions

### Package Installation Notes
When adding new packages, check:
1. React version compatibility
2. Peer dependencies
3. Whether a custom solution is feasible
