Ensuring every citizen in Sweden can vote through DidiS, regardless of access to BankID, requires a careful balance between inclusivity, security, and usability. Here's a plan to achieve this:

---

### 1. **Expand Authentication Options**
While BankID is a highly secure and widely used authentication system in Sweden, it's not universally accessible. To ensure inclusivity, you can incorporate alternative methods of secure authentication:

#### a) **Physical Authentication Tokens (e.g., OTP generators, smartcards)**
   - Provide citizens with hardware-based one-time password (OTP) generators or smartcards for secure authentication.
   - These could be distributed at local government offices or sent by mail.

#### b) **Face-to-Face Registration with Unique IDs**
   - Citizens without BankID could register in person at municipal offices, verifying their identity using government-issued photo IDs (e.g., passports or national ID cards).
   - Upon registration, they could receive a unique access code or credentials for platform login.

#### c) **SMS-Based Authentication**
   - For citizens without BankID, a basic two-factor authentication (2FA) using SMS could be employed. While not as secure as BankID, this provides accessibility for users with only a mobile phone.

#### d) **Email + ID Verification**
   - An email-based system combined with manual identity verification could be implemented for those unable to use BankID or physical tokens. This may require a waiting period for account approval.

### 2. **Public Infrastructure for Digital Inclusion**
#### a) **Free Digital Identity Program**
   - Partner with the Swedish government to introduce a free digital identity program for citizens without BankID, ensuring they have access to secure and verified digital credentials.
   - This could involve creating a new, lightweight alternative to BankID specifically for civic participation.

#### b) **Public Voting Kiosks**
   - Set up secure voting kiosks in libraries, municipal offices, or other public spaces where citizens can authenticate and participate in DidiS. These kiosks could use fingerprint or photo ID authentication.

---

### 3. **Offline Participation with Digital Integration**
#### a) **Paper-Based Voting with Digital Integration**
   - Allow citizens to vote via paper ballots at local polling stations. These votes could then be digitized and integrated into DidiS for full transparency and inclusion.

#### b) **Hybrid Participation**
   - Implement a system where citizens can choose to cast their vote digitally or physically, ensuring everyone can participate.

---

### 4. **Mobile Support and Accessibility**
#### a) **Mobile App Authentication**
   - A lightweight mobile app could provide secure voting options even for citizens with basic smartphones.
   - Support offline modes for citizens in areas with poor internet connectivity.

#### b) **Accessibility Focus**
   - Ensure the platform is designed to meet WCAG standards, enabling participation by citizens with disabilities.

---

### 5. **Public Awareness and Support**
#### a) **Education Campaigns**
   - Launch educational campaigns to help citizens understand how to use DidiS, authenticate securely, and participate effectively.

#### b) **Community Support Centers**
   - Establish centers where citizens can receive help registering, authenticating, and using the platform.

---

### 6. **Technical and Security Measures**
#### a) **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Implement MFA for all users, ensuring that even less secure methods (e.g., SMS) are paired with stronger security measures.

#### b) **Fraud Prevention**
   - Monitor for fraudulent accounts or attempts to exploit alternative authentication methods.
   - Ensure transparency and auditability in decision tracking.

#### c) **Decentralized Identity**
   - Explore the use of decentralized identity technologies, such as self-sovereign identity (SSI), allowing citizens to control their own credentials while maintaining privacy and security.

### Example Workflow for Non-BankID Users:
1. A citizen registers in person at a local municipal office.
2. Their identity is verified using a government-issued ID.
3. They receive either:
   - A physical authentication token.
   - A unique username/password combo for secure access.
4. They log in to DidiS using the provided credentials, with optional MFA for added security.

By combining these approaches, you can ensure DidiS remains inclusive and accessible to all citizens in Sweden while maintaining high standards of security and integrity.
